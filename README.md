# cat-app

https://brittleonard.github.io/cat-app/

In the cat app I was able to pair a carousel of cat images with a random cat fact API to make an app where you can click through photos of cats and get a new fact with each photo. I was trying to access the data for the photos to be randomized but the API was not working correctly and so I had to list each of the photos individually so they would be in the carousel.

I developed this project using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. I also used AJAX to make a request to an external API.

I used an external API for the photos but had to input urls manually and hard code the images into HTML.
